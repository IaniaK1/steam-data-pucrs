232890,Stronghold Crusader 2,"Sep 22, 2014",1000000 - 2000000,425,0,39.99,6,"Stronghold Crusader 2 is the long awaited sequel to Stronghold: Crusader, the original 'castle sim'. After 12 years Stronghold returns to the deserts of the Middle East circa 1189, with a new 3D engine and realistic castle destruction powered by Havok Physics. Crusader 2 will recapture the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation. True to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands. Lead your forces into battle as either Richard the Lionheart or the Sultan of Syria in two historic single-player campaigns, with dynamic events such as tornados and locust swarms. Become the greatest Lord by managing your desert economy and seizing control of vital oases. To dominate the battlefield you will need to command more than 25 unique unit types, mastering their special abilities. Raise morale with the Sergeant at Arms, charge in with the Sassanid Knight, use Archers to launch an arrow volley or scale castle walls with the deadly Assassin. Once your skills have been perfected put them to the test in skirmish mode or take the battle online with up to 8 human and AI players (with a maximum of 4 humans). Create teams, choose different AI opponents and design your own map in the ultimate skirmish or multiplayer game! Features Build the Ultimate Castle - Design mighty strongholds and fill them with fiendish traps to crush your enemies! Skirmish Mode - Lay siege to your enemies in fast-paced custom skirmish matches against the AI. 8 Player Multiplayer (with a maximum of 4 humans) - Mix and match human and AI players, maps and game modes to set up your ideal multiplayer game. Battle a Wide Range of AI Lords - Classic AI characters return alongside new blood, each with distinct personalities, castles and play styles. Challenge the Crusader Trail - Test your mettle across a range of increasingly tough skirmish campaigns. Co-op Play - Share control over castle building, troop control and resource management in Co-op Mode. Castle Sandbox - Dive into the Map Editor or Free Build mode and construct the ultimate castle without fear of attack. Want more?

The game features reward renders with both regular girls as well as futa girls to make sure everyone is happy. Features: - Unique minesweeper-like gameplay. - Infinite replayability with generated puzzles. - 20 sexy images to unlock. - Animated furry girl as your in-game companion - 10 unique backgrounds to unlock - Gallery for all unlocked images. - Can be played with one hand. - Unique art created with help of AI. Gameplay: Each puzzle helps you progress in the game. Solving the puzzle earns you currency which you can use to play more difficult levels. The more expensive the level, the bigger chance in unlocking one of the reward renders! The last difficulty level has a 100% chance for unlock. You need to choose your own strategy how to unlock all images and how to manage your currency. You can also spend your money in the shop, where you can unlock furry girls as companions or backgrounds. The puzzle is a variant on classic minesweeper, where you need to find all the hidden mines in the board. If you click on the mine, you lose the level without earning any money. If you click on a tile, you uncover a number which tells you how many mines are in the neighbourhood of that tile. The first few clicks are 'safe' preventing you from randomly losing when the board hasn't been uncovered yet. You can right click on an empty tile to mark it as mine and if you are correct, it can help you to uncover the board quicker, as left clicking on an uncovered block will safely uncover all its neighbours if the appropriate number has been marked. For example, left-clicking on a 1 will uncover all neighbours when exactly one of them has been marked.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2279560/header.jpg?t=1676937875,,,cutepengames@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,Contains images of sexually explicit content and nudity.

This allows you to compete against other players &amp; also work together with friends. Build your base &amp; develop it further as you find blueprints to craft more durable and more efficient items. Anything you see in the game can be broken and collected. Thus, resource gathering is a big part of the game. As you use gathered items to craft new items to defend yourself &amp; your base. As it develops with time. If no players are online. Don't worry there are bots which regularly attack your base. To challenge your strategic thinking. Your base also slowly decays. So make sure to upgrade things to keep them durable and make them last longer. You can also improve the efficiency if your base's development by focusing on crafting technologies which help you get resources faster. Most of the weapons in this game are strategically based. They can be placed to defend your base. Perhaps hidden behind a bush. Rather than having guns which you use actively to shoot with; You use more of a tower-defense kind of thinking to defend your base. If you so happen to connect with other players. You can easily exchange items in the world or maybe even share electricity between your bases if you are neighbors. Grow plants with unique genetics to keep you fed &amp; craft clothes to endure extreme temperatures. Keep your plant's safe from rats by keeping them inside your base. The world has a temporary world border. Meaning the world grows larger as the player demand for the game increases. Currently the world is almost 1 KM * 1KM(0.62 miles * 0.62) in size.
